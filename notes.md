immutable data -> move after the purity slide
explain what "no side effects" means


show example of variable types usage in strong typing slide


why haskell vs go or rust, scala

ASYNCHRONOUS:: 

talk about event loop, explain what that means, graphic?

- haskell uses green threads (executor unit) - note - think what to talk about when showing this slide
- they can be executed by any amount of OS threads, maximum specified at compile time
- events based execution
- all that is abstracted underneath the language


modules - compare to javascript module patterns (exporting specific things)


SO WHAT CAN I USE IT FOR? - move just after the "haskell" starting slide




=---
maybe provide examples:
- how to convert integer to string



indentation matters - tell it


garbage collection: short intro (generational)


expand on functional programming
